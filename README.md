• We get data from the car website www.cardekho.com, filled with information on a wide variety of cars, including their selling price and present price. We realize that we can use this data to make sure we get a good deal on a new car. In particular, we can figure out exactly how much one should pay for a specific type of car.

• I have used Linear Regression on this dataset for discovering the relationship between two variables in the dataset, such as price of the car and the year it was made. Data Scientists rely on this method for solving a wide range of problems, especially when it comes to prediction.
